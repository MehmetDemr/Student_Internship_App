# Student_Internship_App

## Overview

This project involves designing a Priority Queue data structure to manage student internship applications. Students applying for internships will be added to the queue. 
They will be prioritized based on their GPA, roles in student organizations, and absenteeism. Students with higher GPAs, active roles in student organizations, and fewer absences will be dequeued first.

## Features

Priority Queue Implementation: The project includes a Priority Queue implementation to manage student applications.
Heap Sort Algorithm: The Heap Sort algorithm is used to sort the student applications based on priority criteria.
User Interface: Students in the queue are displayed in a ListBox in sorted order.
Dequeuing Functionality: When the user clicks the "Dequeue" button, the student at the top of the priority queue is dequeued, and their information is displayed on the screen.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.
3. Build and run the project.
## How to Use
Adding Students: Students applying for internships can be added to the priority queue.
Sorting: The priority queue automatically sorts students based on GPA, roles in organizations, and absenteeism.
Dequeuing: Clicking the "Dequeue" button removes the top-priority student from the queue and displays their information.
